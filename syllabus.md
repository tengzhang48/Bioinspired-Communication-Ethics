## üìö Course Description

This graduate-level course is designed to train students from diverse academic backgrounds in interdisciplinary research, with examples from biological and bioinspired systems. The course emphasizes teamwork, scientific communication, and ethical research practices, preparing students to excel in collaborative, cutting-edge research environments. Through a combination of team-based learning (TBL), flipped classroom techniques, and hands-on activities, students will engage with current literature, participate in the full research workflow, and explore the ethical dimensions of scientific inquiry.

The course is structured into four modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of research training. Students will learn to conduct literature reviews, write and review scientific manuscripts, prepare grant proposals, and address ethical challenges in research. Using the CATME platform, students will work in diverse teams to solve problems, present findings, and develop skills in peer evaluation and collaboration. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the tools and knowledge to contribute effectively to interdisciplinary research, with a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, and ethics exemplified through biological and bioinspired systems. Prof. Sarah Reckess, JD, from Upstate Medical University will be guest lecturer in the Ethics module.

## üéØ Course Outcomes

Successful course completion should result in the following student outcomes:

1. **Communication:** Communicate effectively across disciplines by preparing and delivering oral presentations, writing in scientific modalities (e.g., grant proposals, referee reports), and engaging with non-scientific audiences (e.g., industry, public).

2. **Teamwork:** Work effectively in diverse teams, leveraging interdisciplinary perspectives to solve complex problems, and utilize tools like CATME for team-building and peer evaluation.

3. **Research Workflow:** Participate in the full research workflow, from literature review to proposal preparation and scientific presentation, with examples from biological and bioinspired systems.

4. **Ethics:** Apply ethical principles to scientific research, including peer review, dual-use research, research misconduct, and the use of biomatter, and develop moral reasoning skills to address ethical dilemmas.
