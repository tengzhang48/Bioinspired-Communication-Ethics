## 💡 Instructor Notes

This module connects bioinspired principles with proposal development:

- **Bioinspired Proposal Structure**: Just as biological systems optimize for efficiency, research proposals should eliminate unnecessary complexity while maintaining clarity and impact.
- **Evolutionary Proposal Development**: The iterative proposal review process mirrors natural selection, where only the strongest arguments survive critical evaluation.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Emphasize how ethical considerations must be integrated throughout the proposal (e.g., dual-use research implications).

**Implementation Tips**:
- Use CATME for peer review assignments to ensure fair distribution of review workload
- Have students analyze actual NSF award abstracts to understand successful proposals
- Connect proposal exercises to the bioinspired communication theme (e.g., "Develop a proposal for bioinspired communication systems inspired by animal swarm behavior")
