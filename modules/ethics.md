# Module 4: Research Ethics in Bioinspired Communication  

This module provides a focused exploration of ethical considerations in bioinspired research and communication, co-taught by Dr. Sarah Reckess, JD. You'll engage with real-world ethical dilemmas through case studies, debates, and role-playing exercises, developing the moral reasoning skills necessary to navigate complex ethical terrain in interdisciplinary research.

## üìå Key Topics

- Research misconduct and integrity in interdisciplinary contexts  
- Dual-use research considerations for bioinspired technologies  
- Ethical frameworks for biomatter and biological systems  
- Ethical implications of bioinspired communication systems (including AI applications)  
- Regulatory frameworks across disciplinary boundaries  
- Ethical communication of research findings

## üë• Guest Lecturer

### Dr. Sarah Reckess, JD
**Assistant Professor of Bioethics, Upstate Medical University**

> *"The complexity and rapid advances of research, as well as numerous instances of deception, conflicts of interest, and inappropriate practices, suggest that merely having good intentions is not always sufficient. This module will help you develop the moral reasoning skills necessary to navigate ethical challenges in bioinspired research."*

Dr. Reckess brings expertise in biomedical ethics with a focus on regulatory frameworks and professional norms of scientific conduct. Her approach emphasizes practical application of ethical principles to real research scenarios.

## üåê Ethics Frameworks for Bioinspired Research

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Foundational Ethics Principles

- üìÑ [**The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research**](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html)
  > *"Three basic ethical principles‚Äîrespect for persons, beneficence, and justice‚Äîform the foundation for ethical research involving human subjects."* While originally focused on biomedical research, these principles provide a valuable framework for all research involving living systems.

- üìÑ [**NSF's Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Guidelines**](https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/rcr.jsp)
  > *NSF's comprehensive guidelines covering research ethics across all scientific disciplines, with specific sections relevant to interdisciplinary and bioinspired research.*
