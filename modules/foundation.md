# Module 1: Foundations of Teamwork  

This module introduces the essential elements of working in effective, diverse, and interdisciplinary research teams. You'll explore tools like CATME for peer evaluation and learn evidence-based strategies for thriving in collaborative, convergence-driven research environments.

---

## 📌 Key Topics

- Forming strong and functional research teams  
- Using CATME for peer evaluation and role assignment  
- Understanding interdisciplinary and convergence research  
- Thriving in interdisciplinary and cross-domain collaboration

> **CATME Five Teamwork Dimensions**  
> CATME evaluates teams across five critical dimensions that contribute to team effectiveness:
> 1. **Contributing to the Team's Work** - Completing assignments on time with quality
> 2. **Interacting with Teammates** - Communicating effectively and respectfully
> 3. **Keeping the Team on Track** - Maintaining focus and managing time
> 4. **Expecting Quality** - Striving for excellence in all work
> 5. **Having Related Knowledge/Skills** - Bringing relevant expertise to the team

## 👥 Building Effective Teams

  > *"What matters most isn't the personalities or behavior of the team members; it's whether a team has a compelling direction, a strong structure, and a supportive context. Today's teams also need a shared mindset to overcome 'us versus them' thinking and incomplete information."*

## 🌐 Convergence Research

> Convergence research integrates knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines to solve complex societal problems. It goes beyond traditional interdisciplinary work by creating new frameworks that transcend disciplinary boundaries.

## 📚 Required Activities

### ✅ Team Formation & Assessment
1. Complete the CATME team formation survey
2. Participate in the Teamwork Behavior Training module
3. Complete the team role self-assessment activity

### ✅ Team Contract Development
Create a team contract that includes:
- Clear roles and responsibilities
- Communication protocols
- Meeting schedules and expectations
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Quality standards for deliverables

### ✅ Case Analysis: Interdisciplinary Team Conflict
> **Scenario**: Your team includes members from biology, engineering, and ethics backgrounds working on a bioinspired communication project. The biologists want to focus on organism behavior observations, engineers want to jump to prototype development, and ethicists are concerned about potential misuse of the technology. Tensions are rising, and progress has stalled.
> 
> **Task**: 
> 1. Identify the root causes of the conflict using the "us versus them" framework from the HBR article
> 2. Develop a strategy to establish a shared mindset among team members
> 3. Create specific interventions to get the project back on track
> 4. Present your solution to the class

## 💡 Instructor Notes

This module establishes the foundation for all subsequent team-based work in the course. Pay special attention to:
- Ensuring all students complete CATME registration early
- Facilitating the team contract process to prevent future conflicts
- Connecting bioinspired principles to team dynamics (e.g., swarm intelligence models for team coordination)
- Emphasizing how ethical considerations intersect with team formation and dynamics
