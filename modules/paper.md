## ✍️ Scientific Writing Resources

### ▶️ Essential Writing Guides

- 📄 [**"Whitesides' Group: How to Write a Paper"**](https://www.gmwgroup.harvard.edu/publications/whitesides-group-writing-paper)
  > *"A paper is not a scientific result; it is a communication about a scientific result. The goal of writing is communication, not the documentation of research activity."* This seminal guide from Harvard's Whitesides Group provides practical advice on structuring papers, writing clearly, and avoiding common pitfalls.

- 🎥 [**"How to Write a Paper" – Prof. Whitesides Video Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3mrRH2aS98)
  > *This comprehensive video from the Prof. Whitesides covers essential strategies for effective scientific writing, including structure, clarity, and communication principles specifically for bioinspired and interdisciplinary research.*

- 📄 [**TechRabbits: Complete Guide to Scientific Publication**](https://www.hyunwooyuk.com/table-of-contents.html)
  > *This detailed resource covers the entire publication journey from literature reviews through post-acceptance tasks, with specific sections on:*
  > - Publication Process (6-part series covering presubmission to acceptance)
  > - Scientific Figure Preparation (including color theory and design basics)
  > - Literature Review strategies
  > *Particularly valuable for understanding the "Art of Rebuttal" when responding to reviewer comments.*

- 📄 [**Nature Portfolio: Author Instructions**](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies)
  > *Detailed guidelines from one of the world's leading scientific publishers on manuscript preparation, ethical standards, and the submission process.*

- 📄 [**Science Magazine: Writing Resources**](https://www.science.org/content/page/science-authors)
  > *Practical advice for authors on structuring papers, creating effective figures, and navigating the publication process in top-tier journals.*

## 🔍 Peer Review Process

### ▶️ Understanding Peer Review

- 📄 [**Nature: How to Review a Paper**](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/how-review-paper)
  > *"Peer review is the backbone of the scholarly publication system. It helps editors decide which papers to publish and provides authors with constructive feedback to improve their work."* This guide outlines the responsibilities of reviewers and provides a structured approach to evaluation.

- 📄 [**eLife: Transparent Review Process**](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/3d8c981b/transparent-peer-review-at-elife)
  > *"eLife publishes review reports alongside accepted papers, creating a transparent record of the scientific evaluation process."* This resource shows actual examples of published review histories, including:
  > - Initial reviewer comments
  > - Author responses
  > - Final editorial decisions
  > *Excellent for understanding how transparent peer review works in practice.*

- 📄 [**PLOS ONE: Peer Review Criteria**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication)
  > *Transparent criteria used by one of the world's largest open-access journals, emphasizing methodological rigor over perceived impact.*

- 📄 [**COPE: Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers**](https://publicationethics.org/files/Ethical_Guidelines_For_Peer_Reviewers.pdf)
  > *The Committee on Publication Ethics provides essential guidelines for maintaining integrity throughout the review process.*

## 📊 Analyzing Published Reviews

> **Learning from Real Examples**  
> One of the most effective ways to learn peer review is by examining actual published review reports and author responses.

- 📄 [**eLife Published Review Histories**](https://elifesciences.org/articles/87398#public-review)
  > *Browse complete review histories for published eLife papers, including initial submissions, reviewer comments, author responses, and editorial decisions.*

- 📄 [**Nature Communications: Published Peer Review**](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/)
  > *Nature Communications offers authors the option to publish peer review reports alongside their articles.*

- 📄 [**Response to Reviewers: A Template Approach**](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/mental_elixir/how_to_respond_to_peer_reviewers/)
  > *Practical guidance on crafting professional, effective responses to reviewer comments.*

## 🛠️ Required Activities

### ✅ Writing Workshop: Abstract & Introduction

1. **Structured Abstract Writing**
   - Create a structured abstract (Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion) for a bioinspired communication research project
   - Use the [IMRaD format](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/structure-of-a-scientific-paper-14103486/) guidelines

2. **Introduction Framework Practice**
   - Apply the "CARS" (Create A Research Space) model to draft an introduction
   - Focus on establishing context, identifying a research gap, and stating your contribution

### ✅ Peer Review Simulation

1. **Review Practice with Rubric**
   - Evaluate a provided manuscript draft using the [Nature review criteria](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/how-review-paper)
   - Focus on:
     * Originality and significance
     * Technical soundness
     * Clarity of presentation
     * Ethical considerations

2. **Constructive Feedback Training**
   - Practice writing reviews that are:
     * Specific (point to exact sections/lines)
     * Actionable (suggest concrete improvements)
     * Respectful (maintain professional tone)
     * Balanced (note strengths as well as weaknesses)

### ✅ Response to Reviewers Exercise

> **Scenario**: You've received reviewer comments on your bioinspired communication manuscript. Some comments are straightforward, while others challenge your methodology and question your conclusions.
> 
> **Task**:
> 1. Categorize the reviewer comments as major/minor and valid/questionable
> 2. Draft a professional response addressing each comment
> 3. Identify which changes you would make to your manuscript
> 4. For questionable comments, develop a respectful but firm justification for maintaining your approach

## 💡 Instructor Notes

This module connects bioinspired principles with scientific communication:

- **Bioinspired Writing Structure**: Just as biological systems optimize for efficiency, scientific writing should eliminate unnecessary complexity while maintaining clarity.
- **Peer Review as an Evolutionary Process**: The iterative review process mirrors natural selection, where only the strongest arguments survive critical evaluation.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Emphasize how peer review ethics intersect with broader research ethics—particularly regarding dual-use research in bioinspired communication.

**Implementation Tips**:
- Use CATME for peer review assignments to ensure fair distribution of review workload
- Have students analyze actual eLife review histories to see transparent peer review in action
- Connect writing exercises to the bioinspired communication theme (e.g., "Write an abstract for a paper inspired by ant colony communication systems")
