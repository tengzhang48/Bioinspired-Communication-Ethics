> **CATME Five Teamwork Dimensions**  
> CATME evaluates teams across five critical dimensions that contribute to team effectiveness:
> 1. **Contributing to the Team's Work** - Completing assignments on time with quality
> 2. **Interacting with Teammates** - Communicating effectively and respectfully
> 3. **Keeping the Team on Track** - Maintaining focus and managing time
> 4. **Expecting Quality** - Striving for excellence in all work
> 5. **Having Related Knowledge/Skills** - Bringing relevant expertise to the team

## 👥 Building Effective Teams

- 📄 [**"The Secrets of Great Teamwork" – Harvard Business Review**](https://hbr.org/2016/06/the-secrets-of-great-teamwork)
  > *"What matters most isn't the personalities or behavior of the team members; it's whether a team has a compelling direction, a strong structure, and a supportive context. Today's teams also need a shared mindset to overcome 'us versus them' thinking and incomplete information."*
  
- 📄 [**"Team Science: A Guide to Collaborative Research" – National Academies**](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/19007/enhancing-the-effectiveness-of-team-science)
  > *"Successful team science requires attention to team composition, leadership, communication, and institutional support. Teams that invest in relationship-building and shared understanding outperform those that focus solely on technical aspects."*

- 🎥 [**Video: The Science of Building Great Teams – MIT**](https://youtu.be/1XOjUH0cYRI)
  > *Professor Alex Pentland presents research on team dynamics and what makes teams truly effective, based on data from hundreds of teams.*

- 📄 [**NSF Convergence Accelerators: Team Science Strategies**](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18045/nsf18045.pdf)
  > *This NSF guide provides practical strategies for building effective STEM research teams, including case studies of successful convergence research projects.*

- 📄 [**Conflict Resolution in Research Groups: Four Strategies for Finding Resolution**](https://www.science.org/content/article/conflict-your-research-group-here-are-four-strategies-finding-resolution)
  > *"When conflict arises in research groups, addressing it directly and constructively is essential. These four strategies can help researchers navigate disagreements while maintaining productive working relationships."*

## 🔬 What is Interdisciplinary Research?

- 📄 [**National Academies Report: Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research**](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11153/facilitating-interdisciplinary-research)
  > *"Interdisciplinary research integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice."*

🎥 [**Video: How an Interdisciplinary Approach Makes All the Difference – Oxford Martin School**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6R1rK_Yu4)  
> A clear case study showing how Oxford integrates diverse academic strengths to drive collaborative outcomes.

- 📄 [**Case Study: Human Genome Project Collaboration**](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/educational-resources/fact-sheets/human-genome-project)
  > *The Human Genome Project stands as a landmark example of successful interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together biologists, computer scientists, ethicists, and engineers.*

## 🌐 Convergence Research

> Convergence research integrates knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines to solve complex societal problems. It goes beyond traditional interdisciplinary work by creating new frameworks that transcend disciplinary boundaries.

## 📚 Module Activities & Learning Objectives

This module combines theory with practice. Students will engage in hands-on activities designed to build foundational team skills, including:

*   **Team Formation & Self-Assessment:** Using established tools to form balanced teams and understand individual roles and contributions within a group.
*   **Developing a Team Charter:** Collaboratively creating a document that outlines team norms, communication protocols, and conflict resolution strategies to ensure a productive working environment.
*   **Analysis of Interdisciplinary Conflict:** Working through a realistic case study of a stalled research project, students will diagnose communication breakdowns and develop strategies to build a shared mindset and get the collaboration back on track.

**» Detailed assignment instructions, worksheets, and submission portals are available on the course Blackboard site.**
